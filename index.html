ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="56"><p>One Saturday I spent visiting two of the 2,000 or so castles in the Czech Republic: Křivoklát and Karlštejn. 

I departed the dormitory in the company of my esteemed fellow countryman and Wildcat, Matt Sipes; a true gentleman and scholar. Together we braved the beast that is the Czech Railroad system, which can be slightly confusing if you've never done it before. After our baptism of fire, we arrived merely an hour later than planned at the castle Křivoklát, which had its beginnings mostly as a hunting lodge favored by the royalty, then later as a political prison of sorts. It's nestled in the picturesque hills west of Prague, and surrounded on 3 sides by a creek/river/smallish-body-of-water. Since our tour of the Castle wouldn't start for 90 minutes, we indulged ourselves in a bit of crossbow shooting; and climbed the west wall of the castle to look out over the hills before snacking on the Czech version of a hotdog: a long hole is poked into a roll, mustard is poured in and the hotdog is inserted.  Despite our tour of the Castle being given in Czech, we were able to gain enough information about the castle from the English print out we were given. </p></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="57"><p> Because I was not cool enough, Matt returned to Prague at the conclusion of the tour and I ventured on to Karlštejn alone (actually, it was because his decision to accompany me was last minute and in light of prior plans).</p></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="58"><p>Karlštejn, as you can see, is a typical fairy-tale castle. Something you see in your dreams, the scene of the evil usurper who has poisoned the benevolent lord and locked up his beautiful daughter. Little does he know that his callous actions have stirred the blood of the Princess's childhood friend who has just returned from the Crusade and is now galloping up the winding path to put an end to the wicked man's life and save his beloved. Little does he realize that all you get when you rescue a damsel in distress is a distressed damsel. Anyway, I'm not sure where that came from, but anyway this castle and it's village makes for an excellent day trip from Prague, if you're ever in the area and want to get out of the city, but no too far. The only disappointing part of this visit was that they'd closed down 2 of the 3 tour routes, so I only got to see the king's and the kings-men's quarters, along with the reception area (otherwise known as a throne room). The throne room is noteworthy, as the King who founded the castle in 1348, Charles IV, placed the throne directly between two large windows in a dark room, making it very difficult for the visitors to see the King, concealing his poker face (or lack thereof) while illuminating the visiting visages. Gosh, our guide was just the best. 

After the tour was over, I caught the train back to Prague where I partook for the first time in McDonald's French Fries, along with a strawberry milkshake. 


In summation: it was a good day.

I returned to Albano for dinner, which was quite confusing since the Sisters made me a dinner but it was different from what everyone else was eating, even the dessert they made for me was nicer than what the others got (even the priests!). 

Monday morning came, I took my leave of Albano; it was sunny this time around. I headed straight for St. Peter's and spent 3 hours waiting in line to get into the Basilica. During this time I got bored with my camera, I'm sure you can pick out that time period in my photo's. As I was about to enter the Basilica, the crowd started cheering: apparently Francis came out onto the balcony. I could see the Balcony but not him. Oh well. I then mounted the stairs for the cupola, which was quite awesome to say the least. Upon descending I took in as much of the Basilica as I could; it's just so incredibly ginormous. After that I walked along the Tiber to Tiber Island, just to say I did. For lunch I grabbed some pizza that wasn't as good as the stuff I get at home; then took the metro to the train station; the Leonard Express to the Airport; and then arrived back at my room in Prague at 9 in the evening.

far and distant land of Poland. Actually, that's an exaggeration. Poland is just over the east border of the Czech Republic. My destination was the ancient city of Kraków. My transportation was discovered through the ride sharing service known as <a href="http://blablacar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blablacar.com</a>. The next morning I was whisked away to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, a slightly operational salt mine that dates back about 800 years. We descended into the depths of the earth (the highest level is still 100 meters underground), and commenced a 4 hour tour. The main features of the mine are the decorations the workers of the mine (all self taught sculptors) carved out of the salt and the chapels created the same way (the entire mine has about 40 chapels). The mine has two tours one can take, the miners route and the tourist route. The former allows one to reenact the tasks of the bygone days of the mine and the latter is more of a broad overview of the mine and its history. I just might go back to go on the miners route since I only got to go on the tourist route. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="129"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="130"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="131"><a class="" data-reactid="132"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="133"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="134"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a41843049c239d2a3c4d79cc48d3eab2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F031b334a8e412ff1343ce2c926c94e26a3250fdf.jpg&amp;width=1054" style="object-position:94.82421875% 70.42557565789474%;" data-reactid="135"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a41843049c239d2a3c4d79cc48d3eab2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F031b334a8e412ff1343ce2c926c94e26a3250fdf.jpg&amp;width=1054" style="object-position:94.82421875% 70.42557565789474%;" data-reactid="136"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/816638321c4797b43c2daf48a2d507d7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F031b334a8e412ff1343ce2c926c94e26a3250fdf.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:94.82421875% 70.42557565789474%;" data-reactid="137"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b32e78afba94e18fa5f6f0ad903c1469/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F031b334a8e412ff1343ce2c926c94e26a3250fdf.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:94.82421875% 70.42557565789474%;" data-reactid="138"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1054" data-height="703" data-ratio="1.499288762446657" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a41843049c239d2a3c4d79cc48d3eab2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F031b334a8e412ff1343ce2c926c94e26a3250fdf.jpg&amp;width=1054" style="object-position:94.82421875% 70.42557565789474%;" data-reactid="139"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="140"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="141"><h1 data-reactid="142"><span class="" data-reactid="143"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="144">Skoda &amp; Kutna Hora</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 145 --><!-- react-empty: 146 --><!-- react-empty: 147 --><!-- react-empty: 148 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="149"><p>Last week I went on some trips around the Czech Republic with some of the other Erasmus students. On Thursday we went hiking around the country side, it was pretty cool. Then we went to the Skoda Auto museum, that was pretty cool too (Skoda is a Czech Manufacturer of cars). After that we were taken on a tour of their plant, so we got to see the cars being made. Again, pretty cool. They had a lot of robots and stuff. We finished the day at a medieval tavern, where they had all that one would expect from a medieval tavern (e.g. wenches dancing on tables, fights, fire dancing, a hanging, and music on pipes and drums and even a hurdy gurdy). </p></div></div></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global

The name Pigeons and Pates comes from my utter lack of creativity and the fact that despite the wide variety of places I visit, I inevitably photograph pigeons and the strange faces I find.
