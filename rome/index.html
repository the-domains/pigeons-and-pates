<p>Herein are detailed the details of Paschal venture to the Eternal City.

I will preface this account by first saying that in retrospect, I should have gone to Paris for Easter: the disgusting amount of people clogging up the streets in Rome, several acquaintances being in Paris for the Paschal-tide ceremonies, as well as a grander execution of said ceremonies all substantiate this position. Luckily, though, this conclusion was only solidified upon my return; I believed to the very last that I was making the most out of my Easter "break" (at CVUT, the school I was attending, the only "break" is a 4 day weekend).

I arrived at the Leonardo da Vinci Airport Thursday night. I waited there for 6ish hours for the train into the city Friday morning. Upon Arriving in the city, I hoofed it in the general direction of Vatican City. Not so much to visit the Vatican as to collect my Vatican Card/Roma Pass. This package is likely the best tour/sightseeing package you can get, however I would have saved money if I didn't get it: Mother Nature did quite a bit to ensure a less than agreeable stay. The package is about 100 Euro, and you get access to all kinds of museums, public transport, and their open bus. I really only ended up using the bus the most, but if I was to be a bit more collected I would have been able to take greater advantage of that which I had spent my money on. 


Anyway, I collected my pass, and promptly visited the Vatican museum. This was seen in a veritable blur: the large crowds made it impossible to enjoy or savor. I then climbed aboard a sight seeing bus, and rode it to the train station, and from thence departed in the direction of Albano. It was there that I found the SSPX Italian District Seat, ad the small complex housing the small retreat house. It was also there that I found my Fifth Grade Religion teach, Sister Marie Germaine. She confessed that she did not remember me, but only Vic, but it was fine either way because she arranged my room and board for the rest of my stay. That evening I attended the Good Friday Liturgy, dined with the peeps there, and retired to Room 310, coincidentally enough.Â </p><picture>

<p>Saturday morning I headed back to Rome, and it was cold and rainy. I first stopped by St. Mary Major, where I was able to catch the beginning of Tenebrae before continuing on to St. John Lateran. The pictures simply don't convey the sheer size of the front facade. It's wonderfully excessive, really. Inside the ancient cloister there, there's also the marble slab the reputably was the one upon which they cast dice for His vestiture, behind four posts that supposedly mark the height of Christ. As you can see from the photos, He's taller than me. If I could just grow another inch I would be fine. Anyway, I went on to the Coliseum, but I didn't go inside; instead I took the metro down to St. Paul Outside the walls. The Easter crowds didn't make it that far outside the city, so it was pretty quiet down there, and I ate my lunch that was packed for me by the Sisters outside. This basilica is the one that has the papal portraits, and I thought that by itself Francis' was pretty cool, as it is a mosaic, but it looks like a picture; but taken with the rest of them, it seems a little out of place. After I puttered about there, I headed back into the city, I walked through the Circus Maximus, and spent the rest of the afternoon walking about the Palatine Hill; and then headed back to Albano. 

The Easter Vigil ceremonies started out with a bang: lightning struck just above us, I could even see sparks! But otherwise everything went as planned. It was rushed a bit, however. The Exsultet was practically read, not sung. the ceremonies concluded shortly after midnight. In the photos you can also see some of the students from Canada who were on their senior trip in Italy; most of the were Americans (there was a Neinaber and a Quain cousin) and there was a Zepf too.</p><picture>

<p>I slept in all the way until 8, and took the hour trip once more into the city. my itinerary featured such sights as the Pantheon, which I'm still inconclusive about whether or not the dome ornamentations are painted on or not; riding about on a bus to get out of the rain, and visiting Paul Outside the Walls again. I returned to Albano for dinner, which was quite confusing since the Sisters made me a dinner but it was different from what everyone else was eating, even the dessert they made for me was nicer than what the others got (even the priests!). 

Monday morning came, I took my leave of Albano; it was sunny this time around. I headed straight for St. Peter's and spent 3 hours waiting in line to get into the Basilica. During this time I got bored with my camera, I'm sure you can pick out that time period in my photo's. As I was about to enter the Basilica, the crowd started cheering: apparently Francis came out onto the balcony. I could see the Balcony but not him. Oh well. I then mounted the stairs for the cupola, which was quite awesome to say the least. Upon descending I took in as much of the Basilica as I could; it's just so incredibly ginormous. After that I walked along the Tiber to Tiber Island, just to say I did. For lunch I grabbed some pizza that wasn't as good as the stuff I get at home; then took the metro to the train station; the Leonard Express to the Airport; and then arrived back at my room in Prague at 9 in the evening.

I headed straight for St. Peter's and spent 3 hours waiting in line to get into the Basilica. During this time I got bored with my camera, I'm sure you can pick out that time period in my photo's. As I was about to enter the Basilica, the crowd started cheering: apparently Francis came out onto the balcony. I could see the Balcony but not him. Oh well. I then mounted the stairs for the cupola, which was quite awesome to say the least. Upon descending I took in as much of the Basilica as I could; it's just so incredibly ginormous. After that I walked along the Tiber to Tiber Island, just to say I did. For lunch I grabbed some pizza that wasn't as good as the stuff I get at home; then took the metro to the train station; the Leonard Express to the Airport; and then arrived back at my room in Prague at 9 in the evening. \n\n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/102986208292839376884/albums/6135401193562417521?authkey=CLqzjMKjueLL6AE\">You can see the pictures
