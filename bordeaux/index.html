As always, there's an album of pictures to accompany this communique, the link is somewhere down there at the bottom. 

The adventures began Thursday evening, I flew out of Prague and landed in Paris, at Charles de Gaulle Airport. This is important to note because I was supposed to fly out of Paris Orly Airport, which is on the complete opposite side of Paris. I suspected having a change of airport like that might be a bad idea, but since I landed in Paris at 10 pm and my flight out of Paris was at 6 am, I figured I had plenty of time in case something went wrong. I am now here to tell you that if you ever think that's a good idea, it isn't. It took a 2 hour, 10€ train ride followed by a 30 min, 40€ taxi ride to change airports. Supposedly a shuttle runs direct between the airports, but I suspect not at night. Anyway, I slept in Orly, only to wake up briefly to stumble onto the plane and conclude my snooze therein. I arrived in Bordeaux, and made my way to the city center, and commenced 6 hours of traipsing about the place. You'll see in the photos the Bordeaux Cathedral, with its spires on one of the transepts, rather than at the back of the church; the Church of Notre-Dame, a smallish Dominican chapel and my favorite one there. Later that afternoon, I rendezvoused with Nicole Moynihan and Isabella Morgali, my old college classmates who have been teaching this past year in Saint Macaire. We traipsed about together some more, before heading over to the La Champs, who so kindly provided us a place to sleep. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/869bc9d5-0b1a-4734-9166-ccd9e3c9169d.JPG"><p>The next morning we set on in the company of the La Champs for the place of meeting for the pilgrimage. "Pilgrimage?" you must be asking yourself. Yes, pilgrimage. Saturday and Sunday of this trip were to be spent walking from Bordeaux to the Shrine Notre Dame de Verdelais, which you can <a href="http://goo.gl/9WK1Fp">read all about here</a>. Basically, standard pilgrimage fare: miraculous image that peeps walk to in order to beg favors from Our Lady. Anyway, so yeah. We walked from Bordeaux to Verdelais. We spent Saturday night in a chateaux (it wasn't as cool as it sounds), before nodding off we were entertained with various skits and games courtesy of Le Guide (pronounces "leh gee-day", I think), which is the French (and oddly better) version of the American Boy/Girl Scouts. 


The French have a quaint way of singing anything and everything (I have no idea what the French Blessing for meal is because they sang a different version every time. Also, the night before at the La Champs, when they discovered that I hadn't yet packed victuals for the pilgrimage, promptly forced upon me enough food to double my backpack's weight, so yeah, French people are exceedingly generous. 


Sunday morning we continued the walking, and later that evening arrived at the Shrine, and ended the Pilgrimage with a Mass. Since the majority of the people at Mass joined the Pilgrimage either at breakfast or lunch on Sunday, a lengthy sermon was still given. Even though it was entirely in French, I still nodded my assent at everything that was said (at least that's what I'm told I did).  

Following that, we repaired to the Boutéa de Rivou family's house, just down the street from where Nicole and Isabella live and work in Saint Macaire, for dinner. Nicole and Isabella returned to their abodes, and I spent the night at the Boutéa's. 


On Monday, I was shown about St. Macaire, then an acquaintance of the Boutéa's whisked me back to Bordeaux, where more wandering took place until I started my winged journey back to Prague. 


And so concludes my account of this weekend's adventures; next up: Rome for Easter.
