Actually, that's an exaggeration. Poland is just over the east border of the Czech Republic. My destination was the ancient city of Kraków. My transportation was discovered through the ride sharing service known as <a href="http://blablacar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blablacar.com</a>. The next morning I was whisked away to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, a slightly operational salt mine that dates back about 800 years. We descended into the depths of the earth (the highest level is still 100 meters underground), and commenced a 4 hour tour. The main features of the mine are the decorations the workers of the mine (all self taught sculptors) carved out of the salt and the chapels created the same way (the entire mine has about 40 chapels). The mine has two tours one can take, the miners route and the tourist route. The former allows one to reenact the tasks of the bygone days of the mine and the latter is more of a broad overview of the mine and its history. I just might go back to go on the miners route since I only got to go on the tourist route. </p><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102986208292839376884/albums/6123960569433721681?authkey=CIS-hI-_8eb7OA" title="">Here are pictures</a></p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8120accb-50eb-4e82-8057-69d13420102e.JPG"><p>Upon returning to Kraków (the Mine is located about 45 min outside the city), I went on a walking tour of the Old Jewish Quarter. Basically what happened was when the Jews came to town in the Middle Ages and developed quite a presence, the King had to come down hard on them and enforce the "no Jews in city limits" law; so he moved them 800 meters to their own city (he didn't want them to go away as they were of economic importance, but the law is the law). This neighborhood became the hood of the Jews, until the Nazis forced them to move into the ghetto (15,000 people forced into a place where 3,000 people lived). Krakow never recovered their Jewish population: today the Jewish Quarter is inhabited largely by Gentiles, although many Jews visit throughout the year. 

Once that was over, I headed to a gun range and sampled the firepower of a 9mm Glock, an Uzi, an AK-47, and a good ol' shotgun. 

The day was ended with more traipsing and consuming the delicious street food zapiekanka.

Sunday dawned, I headed to Mass in a moderately sized chapel that was rather crowded, afterwards I checked out of the Hostel, and traipsed about more until my ride arrived and we went back to Prague. 

Here's the pictures.

This concludes my second Expatriatic Epistle.</p><picture>
