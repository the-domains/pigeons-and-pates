# Paris with Christine

I remember during my first jaunt across the ancestral stomping grounds, I felt almost derision for other American travelers; thinking "I've already done all my preparations for this trip, I've done my research, you do your own homework". Generally speaking, I tried to avoid them. Now that I have lived in a foreign land for a few months, like-minded and familiar company is hard to come by. Consequently, upon realizing that a vague acquaintance of mine was serving as Au Pair or some such to a French Family somewhere around Paris, I was determined to avail myself of this not-so distant familiar company. In addition, given the well established rail network that criss-crosses Europe, as well the excellent resource known as The Man in Seat Sixty-One, my bucket list called for taking at least one overnight train while living in Europe. 
Unsurprisingly, I readily agreed to spend Christine's last day in Europe romping about Paris. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc20a4a0-2dc6-4655-97eb-bf2b49a8c1d4.JPG)

The tale begins the night before, I took the Phoenix from Prague to Cologne, and then the high-speed Thalys into Paris. All told, I spent 15 hours in transit (12 overnight, 3 the next morning). While it certainly was not uncomfortable, the boredom was excruciating given the utter lack of entertainment that I brought along with me. The train departed the main Prague station and I spent the next hour or so in conversation with on of my "roommates". The sleeper car of the Phoenix is divided into 6 person rooms (during the day the top most bunks can be folded flat against the wall and everyone sits on the bottom bunk), the room I had departed Prague with only 2 others: an elderly gentleman who only spoke German, and an Albanian barber married to a Czech woman who had a shop in Amsterdam and was smuggling his tiny dog on the train. It was with the latter I engaged in conversation (or rather he did the engaging) for the remainder of my evening; and once the sun set, we established ourselves in our bunks, and I slept more or less continuously throughout the night, waking only when we stopped in Berlin to add 3 more passengers to the rest of the bunks. As a passenger, one is provided with a pillow, a sort of person-sized pillow case, and a fleece blanket; all in all not too shabby or uncomfortable (in fact, not at all). My verdict on overnight trains is that they are only worth it if you can arrive at your destination in the morning (effectively combining a flight and a hotel room); if you have to continue your journey for 3 more hours you should bring something to do. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/178497a4-4b18-45f2-a694-2b8106792d56.JPG)

The next morning I alighted on the platform of Köln Hbf, broke my fast with a ham and cheese croissant, pan au chocolate, and a cappuccino to wash it all down; then climbed aboard the Thalys and finished my exodus at Paris Nord. From thence I took the RER B line to the Luxembourg Gardens, which was our rendezvous point. Now, we had not agreed upon an exact time, Christine had said "let's meet at 10:30ish". To be on the safe side, I arrived outside Port Saint-Michel, the east entrance to the gardens, at 10:22\. If I had only reread what she had said, "10:30ish", I would have realized how unnecessary that was. Below you can see her carefree smile as she saunters through the gate a mere twenty minutes past the appointed time. Of course, I relate this for entertainment purposes only, the gardens are beautiful and I only went through all our messages 13 or so times to tredecuple-check if I had made some mistake, but as usual I was the one who was right. ;) Nevertheless, we began our day in earnest, glancing quickly through the Garden and then walking up the street to the Pantheon; where we peeked into Saint-Étienne-du-Mont before dashing over to Saint-Sulpice. We also stopped by another church which is one of the few remaining churches that has maintained its painted appearance though the ages (most if not all Gothic Churches were actually painted, not just bare stone).

We then proceeded to Saint-Gervais, walking along the Seine and crossing in front of the iconic Notre Dame; after that we stopped into Basilique Notre-Dame des Victoires. Lunch followed, we dined at a sandwich place in front of the Paris Opera, after which we sauntered down to Saint . Lunch followed, we dined at a sandwich place in front of the Paris Opera, after which we sauntered down to the Church of the Madeleine, which is modeled remarkably like a grecian temple. Once we had explored that to our satisfaction, we headed down the street to the train station, Saint Lazare. It was there that we parted ways, her to finish her packing before flying home to Saint Louis and I to catch my flight back to Prague. I don't think I could use "Saint" more times in a paragraph on purpose. 

But wait. That's not all!

Oh no, it isn't. 

We had been keeping close track of the time to ensure that I would arrive at the airport at least 45 minutes before my flight. So once I said goodbye to Christine, I engaged the process of going to the airport, which meant I stopped looking at the time, but only completing each leg of the journey as quickly as possible. The journey consisted of the metro ride from Saint Lazare to Antony, then catching the Orly-val (a maglev shuttle between the metro station and ORLY), and then booking it to the check in. To the best of my knowledge, I arrived at the preplanned 45-minutes prior. I attempted to print my boarding pass from the machines provided, however the machine instructed me to check in with an agent. The agents, unfortunately were not present at their desk.  Frustrated is a good word to describe watching my flight not close for another 30 minutes while not being able to board it due to my poor choice in airlines (Transavia, in this case). The lesson is, kids, the lower the price you paid for your ticket, the sooner you should arrive at the airport. Transavia would later only refund me the fees, insisting that I didn't arrive soon enough (their website states check-in closes 40 minutes prior to flight).

The next cheapest way home was an overnight bus the next day departing at six in the evening. I didn't really want to go to my Czech Language Class and Architectural Design Studio anyway.

I spent the night, sleepless at the airport since at least it warmish and had wifi. 

Lucky for me, the next day was cold and rainy, the very epitome of dreary. But hey, at least I got to see the Eiffel Tower again. I spent most of it trying to convince myself it wasn't all that cold and miserable out, and then proving that hypothesis wrong. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a1cb3d19-a219-4327-ad09-d361ce47cd55.JPG)

The bright side of the unplanned additional day in Paris was I now had time to visit Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet, the only church in Paris where every side altar is still used and cared for, the only church in Paris not ruined with some distasteful, out of place table of some kind; where the original high altar is used every day the way it was when it was first built. This is truly the only church in Paris where the One, True Faith is unquestionably lived and celebrated with the full pomp and splendor afforded by rich setting of the 17th Century church. 

Not wanting a repeat performance of the day before, I arrived at the bus station 3 hours before the bus left at. The bus seats were uncomfortable and I hardly slept, but luckily the one next to me was unoccupied, which I took full, almost excessive, advantage of. We arrived in Prague shortly before 9am. To placate my aching soul, I feasted on a BBQ burger of some kind from Burger King and an Oreo Ice Cream.

Cheers for now, I'm going to find something to eat.
