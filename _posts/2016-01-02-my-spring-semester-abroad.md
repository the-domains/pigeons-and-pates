## My 2015 Spring Semester Abroad

Although I began this website as a blog, which was in turn started as a bunch of emails to family and friends, I didn't really like Weebly's blog functionality, in addition this is not an ongoing project, thus making the blog experience less-than-ideal for reading about my adventures. The name Pigeons and Pates comes from my utter lack of creativity and the fact that despite the wide variety of places I visit, I inevitably photograph pigeons and the strange faces I find. Here you will find the accounts of the various ventures I partook in while a Kansas State University Exchange Student at Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fe019268-ee1c-4573-8a90-93c748347225.JPG)
