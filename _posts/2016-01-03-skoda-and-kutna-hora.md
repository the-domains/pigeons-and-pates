# Skoda & Kutna Hora

Last week I went on some trips around the Czech Republic with some of the other Erasmus students. On Thursday we went hiking around the country side, it was pretty cool. Then we went to the Skoda Auto museum, that was pretty cool too (Skoda is a Czech Manufacturer of cars). After that we were taken on a tour of their plant, so we got to see the cars being made. Again, pretty cool. They had a lot of robots and stuff. We finished the day at a medieval tavern, where they had all that one would expect from a medieval tavern (e.g. wenches dancing on tables, fights, fire dancing, a hanging, and music on pipes and drums and even a hurdy gurdy).

The next day I went with another group to Kutna Hora, an old town that had its heyday back in the 1300's or so when the monks discovered silver there. We started off at a chateaux, one of the vestigial trappings of the wealth the region once enjoyed. The duke who had it built was actually pretty cool, cuz he started tons of schools for everyone (especially the poor) to be musically educated (he made sure all of his servants were trained as well). Next stop was one of the Cathedrals in Kutna Hora, it's the oldest church in Central Europe and was built in 30 years, thanks to the tenacity of the Cistercian monks who worked on it and the abundance of funds. Nearby was the Ossuary, which is a repository of human remains, (basically a chapel decorate with bones). There's about 40,000 people remains inside. They got that many almost in one year alone thanks to the plague: 30,000 people died. St. Barbara's Cathedral was next (there's only 2 other cathedrals in the Czech Republic); St. Barbara was hailed as the patron of the miners, so they built a huge cathedral for her. The trip was concluded with a tour of a brewery, where I ascertained that I still don't like beer.
