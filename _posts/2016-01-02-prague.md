Having only lived there for a short 4 months, I certainly wouldn't consider myself a bona-fide Praguian, but I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say I now possess an appreciation and knowledge of this jewel in the heart of Europe. Located in central Europe (Prague is well west of any of the centers of Europe), this bustling city is the largest in the Czech Republic. Claimed by many nations over the centuries, Prague has always been a capital of culture and the arts. Of course I did not know this when I landed that cold morning, but my first impressions were incredibly favorable. Other countries take note, the single best way to impart a favorable impression of your country is to greet people with kindness and generosity. It is precisely with that I was met: my host university has a very effective International Student Organization that organizes a Czech Buddy Program, where incoming students are paired with volunteers who take the time to ensure the students are all settled and Czeched in (ehehe I crack me up). The gods smiled up me and I was paired with the angelic Soňa Cicoňová, who thankfully didn't kill me despite the constant odd requests and pestering I provided her with during my stay. Over the next few days I became acquainted with the other people in the flat. Ben, a fellow K-Stater drew the short straw of being my roommate, blessed me by being my roommate; he is just an all around good, considerate fellow who I would be happy to room with. Next door there was Gaby, also a Wildcat and a very smart and pretty one at that; and Elva, the crazy, kind Mexican girl from El Paso. The remaining room was populated by the dynamic duo Simone and Phil, both party animals from Montreal; and the quiet, self-reliant Fin, Alexi. Together we successfully piloted the Marasykova Green 303 ship to its glorious end, leaving her in much better shape than when we found her (of course that's thanks to me and an all-night cleaning party after everyone else had left, but that's another story). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ba8b24ca-30c2-40f9-bf0d-17f499428b23.png)

Over the course of the next few months I did all kinds of wonderful things in the small area around the bend in the Vltava River: climbing rock walls, attending a Jazz Concert, [listening to buskers outside the castle][0], watching Don Giovanni on the same stage it premiered conducted by Mozart himself, chilling in a hammock a short distance from the Prague Metronome, and so much more. Such a quantity in fact, that I don't believe I will be able to make the self-imposed deadline of finishing this site today. If the spirit moves me, I may commit the entirety of my experience to the typed word, until then you'll just have to ask me how it went and I'll be more than happy to tell you.
