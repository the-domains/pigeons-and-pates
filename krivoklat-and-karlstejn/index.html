<p>One Saturday I spent visiting two of the 2,000 or so castles in the Czech Republic: Křivoklát and Karlštejn. 

I departed the dormitory in the company of my esteemed fellow countryman and Wildcat, Matt Sipes; a true gentleman and scholar. Together we braved the beast that is the Czech Railroad system, which can be slightly confusing if you've never done it before. After our baptism of fire, we arrived merely an hour later than planned at the castle Křivoklát, which had its beginnings mostly as a hunting lodge favored by the royalty, then later as a political prison of sorts. It's nestled in the picturesque hills west of Prague, and surrounded on 3 sides by a creek/river/smallish-body-of-water. Since our tour of the Castle wouldn't start for 90 minutes, we indulged ourselves in a bit of crossbow shooting; and climbed the west wall of the castle to look out over the hills before snacking on the Czech version of a hotdog: a long hole is poked into a roll, mustard is poured in and the hotdog is inserted.  Despite our tour of the Castle being given in Czech, we were able to gain enough information about the castle from the English print out we were given. </p><p> Because I was not cool enough, Matt returned to Prague at the conclusion of the tour and I ventured on to Karlštejn alone (actually, it was because his decision to accompany me was last minute and in light of prior plans).</p><picture>

<p>Karlštejn, as you can see, is a typical fairy-tale castle. Something you see in your dreams, the scene of the evil usurper who has poisoned the benevolent lord and locked up his beautiful daughter. Little does he know that his callous actions have stirred the blood of the Princess's childhood friend who has just returned from the Crusade and is now galloping up the winding path to put an end to the wicked man's life and save his beloved. Little does he realize that all you get when you rescue a damsel in distress is a distressed damsel. Anyway, I'm not sure where that came from, but anyway this castle and it's village makes for an excellent day trip from Prague, if you're ever in the area and want to get out of the city, but no too far. The only disappointing part of this visit was that they'd closed down 2 of the 3 tour routes, so I only got to see the king's and the kings-men's quarters, along with the reception area (otherwise known as a throne room). The throne room is noteworthy, as the King who founded the castle in 1348, Charles IV, placed the throne directly between two large windows in a dark room, making it very difficult for the visitors to see the King, concealing his poker face (or lack thereof) while illuminating the visiting visages. Gosh, our guide was just the best. 

After the tour was over, I caught the train back to Prague where I partook for the first time in McDonald's French Fries, along with a strawberry milkshake. 


In summation: it was a good day.
